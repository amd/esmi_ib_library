# Specifications

## Processors:
Target released for AMD EPYC™ processor Family 19h, model 0h-1Fh, 30h-3Fh, 90h-9Fh, A0h-AFh and Family 0x1A model 0h-1Fh.

## Operating Systems
AMD ESMI In-band library is tested on following distributions
* Ubuntu 18.04, 20.04
* SUSE SLES 15 and
* RHEL 8.1

# Dependency
This new e-smi release works well with [amd_hsmp](https://github.com/amd/amd_hsmp.git) driver version 2.4.
Not all features will work with version < 2.4. Setting cpu rail iso frequency policy, df c-state enabling,
xGMI pstate range setting etc will only work with 2.4 version of amd_hsmp driver.
